National Vulnerability Database (NVD) Downloader
================================================

Downloads NVD Feeds and does some simplistic parsing.

Downloads all NVD data feeds. Attempts to turn them into usable CSV files.

This whole script is a **quick hack**. 

I am suspicious of the CSV output as it hacked together and not strictly checked
that all things are properly escaped - but it is a place to start. 

Use at your own risk.
